## üéØ Project Background

This project was developed during my Machine Learning internship at Enat College Shashemene. The system was designed to address the growing need for reliable remote examination proctoring, combining cutting-edge ML technologies with practical educational requirements.

## üöÄ Overview

Proctor is a state-of-the-art online examination proctoring system that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations. Built with the MERN stack and powered by TensorFlow.js, it provides real-time monitoring capabilities through advanced computer vision algorithms.
